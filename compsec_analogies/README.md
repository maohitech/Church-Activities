This is a really contrived analogy: Our spirits may be likened to a computers in a foreign network. God is the perfect sysadmin. Satan is the malicious hacker. God's team also has hackers: the missionaries! Every member a missionary. The truths listed here are ideas that I have accumulated as I work in computer security.

<h2 id="recon">Reconnaissance</h2>

* [Mathew 5:14-16}(https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/5.14?lang=eng) We all need to expose some characteristics to the enemy. Some ports need to be open. A server without open ports may not serve clients.
* []() Scan yourself to find what you value the most in life and what you expose to others

<h2 id="enumeration">Enumaration</h2>

* [Ether 12:27](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/12?lang=eng) We all have weakness. Satan will look for all these weaknesses
* []() What are you weaknesses?



<h2 id="exploitation">Exploitation</h2>

* [2 Nephi 28:21](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.21?lang=eng) Satan's techniques. Lull into carnal security. No one will hack us.
* []() Have the spirit. It is a powerful metasploit framework

<h2 id="privesc">Privilege Escalation</h2>

* []() It's just a matter of time before Satan privilege escalates your spirit
* []() It's just a matter of time before the small seed of faith converts you conviction about Jesus Christ

<h2 id="post_exploit">Post Exploitation</h2>

* []() Satan will use you to create a botnet by infecting other people
* []() God can use you to convince other people of the Gospel
* []() Addiction is a rootkit. You may need to reformat your system


<h2 id="topics">Topics</h2>

<h3 id="re">Reverse Engineering</h3>

* []() Reverse engineer yourself to understand your weaknesses
* []() Jesus can extract the malware in your spirit

<h3 id="pwn">Pwn</h3>

* [Mathew 7:14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/7.14?lang=en) There are many things you can do within the strait and narrow path. When hacking you need to run arbitrary software in the context of an application.
* []() Make sure the input size is checked or you may crash. Don't run more than you can afford
* []() Check that the input is not malicious
* []() Strenghten your faith with friends or scripture (stack canaries)
* []() Small character weaknesses may be a memory leak to the enemy
* []()

<h3 id="webappsec">Web Application Security</h3>

* []() 

<h3 id="crypto">Cryptography</h3>
	
* [Mark 4:11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/4.11?lang=eng) The mysteries of God are hidden with hard cryptography
